# Problem 1

***Data Exploration***

Importing Data

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

Finding number of users

``` r
instacart %>%
  select(user_id) %>%
    distinct %>%
      count
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##        n
    ##    <int>
    ## 1 131209

Average days in between orders (capped at 30)

``` r
mean(instacart$days_since_prior_order, na.rm =TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 17.06613

Finding peak order hours

``` r
max_df <-
instacart %>%
  group_by(order_hour_of_day) %>%
  summarize(
     n = n_distinct(order_id)
    ) 

max_df %>%
    arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 × 2
    ##    order_hour_of_day     n
    ##                <int> <int>
    ##  1                14 11103
    ##  2                15 11075
    ##  3                13 10711
    ##  4                12 10622
    ##  5                11 10610
    ##  6                10 10585
    ##  7                16 10495
    ##  8                17  9353
    ##  9                 9  9033
    ## 10                18  7558
    ## # … with 14 more rows
    ## # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows

This dataset has 15 columns and 1,384,617 rows with each row
representing a product from an order. Key variables include information
on the customer identifier, order identifier and product name.
Additionally, there is information on the day of the week on which the
order was placed, the hour in which it was placed and number of days
since the previous order. To provide even more details, this dataset
also includes the department name and aisle in which the product would
be found. In total, there were a total of 131,209 unique users in this
dataset. The average day in between orders was \~17 days and on average,
orders peaked around 3pm.

***How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
ordered from?***

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
   arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows
    ## # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows

There are 134 aisle and the most commonly ordered from aisles are the
fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, and packed fruit and vegetables aisles.

***Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.***

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

***Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
table.***

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
    group_by(aisle) %>% 
      count(product_name) %>% 
        mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
        filter(rank < 4) %>% 
          arrange(desc(n)) %>%
            knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |

***Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format
this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).***

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
    group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
      summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
        spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
           knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |
